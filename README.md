## Remaining AI challenges in 2023

### Common Sense

AI cannot do "Common Sense" and this is the dark matter of intelligence. Normal matter is what we see, what we can interact with, but dark matter is the stuff of the universe that we know is there but cannot see. Common sense is like that dark matter, it is the unspoken, implicit knowledge that we all have. It’s so obvious that we often don’t talk about it. Consider the question "Can birds fly?" The obvious anser is "yes", but there are exceptions and it turns out that exceptions are not exceptional, humans can think of them even though nobody told us specifically about these exceptions - we simply apply common sense to derive these exceptions.

### Value pluralism

Value is not singular, when it comes to value there is no universal truth. A lot of people feel uncomfortable about this because as scientists, we are trained to be very precise and strive for one truth, but in many areas of human knowledge there is no universal truth. The rules that might derive truth cannot easily be written down as universal truths, because when applied in different contexts, that assumed truth will lose its relevence.


### Types of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning

Supervised and unsupervised learning are two main categories of machine learning. The main difference between the two is the presence or absence of labeled data during the training process.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the input data is labeled with the correct output values. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input to output by training a model on labeled data. The model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning include image classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

#### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the input data is not labeled with the correct output values. Instead, the goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns or structure in the input data. Unsupervised learning algorithms try to learn relationships and structure in the data without any explicit guidance. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.
