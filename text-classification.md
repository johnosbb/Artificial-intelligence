## Glossary of NLP Terms

- __Vectorizer__:  A component or tool that is used to convert raw text data into numerical vectors.
- __Vectors__: A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers or values. These are typically used to represent individual data points or features and can represent quantities like position, direction, or a list of values. A vector is often represented as a column matrix (n x 1) or a row matrix (1 x n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the vector.
- __Matrix__: A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers or values consisting of rows and columns and is often used to represent data in a tabular format.
- __Dense Matrix__: A dense matrix is one in which most of the elements are non-zero and explicitly stored. It is characterized by having a value assigned to almost every element, regardless of whether it's zero or non-zero. Dense matrices are memory-intensive because they store every element, even if many of them are zero.
- __Sparse Matrix__: A sparse matrix is one in which most of the elements are zero, and only the non-zero elements are explicitly stored. It is characterized by having very few non-zero elements relative to the total number of elements in the matrix. Sparse matrices are memory-efficient because they only store non-zero elements and their positions.

## Vectorizers
A vectorizer, in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, is a component or tool that is used to convert raw text data into numerical vectors. It's a crucial step in preparing text data for machine learning algorithms, as most machine learning models require numerical input data. Vectorization allows you to represent text in a format that can be processed and analyzed by these models.

There are different types of vectorizers commonly used in NLP:

### Count Vectorizer:

Count vectorization, often referred to as the "Bag of Words" model, represents text by counting the frequency of each word in a document.
Each document is represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the count of a specific word.
It results in a high-dimensional and sparse vector representation.

### TF-IDF Vectorizer (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):

TF-IDF vectorization represents text by considering both the term frequency (how often a word appears in a document) and the inverse document frequency (how unique a word is across all documents).
It assigns a weight to each term in a document, emphasizing important terms while reducing the impact of common words.
Like count vectorization, it results in high-dimensional and sparse vectors.

### Word Embedding Vectorizer:

Word embedding techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText map words to continuous-valued vectors in a lower-dimensional space.
These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, making them more informative than simple word counts.
Word embeddings are dense vectors, meaning they have fewer dimensions than the vocabulary size.

### Character-level Vectorizer:

Character-level vectorization represents text by encoding characters or character n-grams as numerical vectors.
It is useful for capturing morphological and spelling patterns in text.

### Custom Vectorizers:

In some cases, custom vectorization techniques are developed to address specific NLP tasks or domain-specific requirements.

The choice of vectorizer depends on the specific NLP task, the nature of the text data, and the machine learning algorithm being used. Vectorizers are an essential part of text preprocessing and feature engineering in NLP pipelines, enabling the transformation of text data into a format suitable for training and applying machine learning models.
