# Using an NPU to Accelerate Inference

A Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is a specialized hardware accelerator designed to optimize the performance of machine learning (ML) tasks, especially for inference. Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions or decisions based on new data. NPUs are tailored to the unique requirements of these tasks, providing significant improvements in speed and efficiency compared to traditional processors like CPUs or even GPUs.

## Optimized Data Flow Architecture

- Parallel Processing: NPUs are designed to handle highly parallelizable operations, which are common in ML tasks like matrix multiplications and convolutions.
- Data Movement Minimization: They often use architectures that minimize data movement (e.g., by using on-chip memory), reducing latency and energy consumption.
- Pipeline Optimization: NPUs implement pipelining and parallelism to process multiple data streams simultaneously, ensuring continuous execution of inference tasks.

## Specialized Compute Units

- Matrix and Tensor Operations: NPUs are optimized for linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplications (a core operation in ML), using hardware blocks like systolic arrays or vector processors.
- Fixed-Point Arithmetic: Many NPUs use lower-precision fixed-point arithmetic (e.g., INT8) instead of floating-point arithmetic to perform calculations more efficiently while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

## Custom Instruction Sets

- NPUs include instructions specifically designed for ML workloads, such as activation functions, pooling operations, and normalization. This eliminates the overhead of executing these tasks using general-purpose instructions.

## On-Chip Memory

- NPUs include high-bandwidth, low-latency memory close to the compute units. This design reduces the need for frequent data transfers to and from external memory, a common bottleneck in ML inference.

## Model Compression and Pruning Support

- NPUs often support compressed or sparse model formats (e.g., weight pruning, quantization) natively, which reduces the computational workload and memory requirements during inference.

## Concurrency Management

- NPUs can process multiple model layers or batches simultaneously by efficiently scheduling and managing hardware resources. This capability is especially beneficial for complex models with diverse layer types.
  Example Use Case: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  For tasks like image recognition, an NPU will:

Break down convolutions into smaller parallelizable units.
Execute these units in specialized compute blocks for high throughput.
Use on-chip memory to store intermediate results, reducing memory latency.
Perform post-processing tasks like activation functions efficiently using custom hardware.
By addressing the unique demands of ML inference, NPUs achieve significantly higher performance and efficiency, enabling real-time applications in fields like autonomous driving, healthcare, and natural language processing.

The Luckfox Pico Pro is a compact Linux microdevelopment board powered by the Rockchip RV1106 system-on-chip (SoC). This SoC integrates a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) designed to accelerate machine learning inference tasks.

RV1106 is a highly integrated vision processor SoC for IPC, especially for AI related
application.
It is based on single-core ARM Cortex-A7 32-bit core which integrates NEON and FPU.
There is a 32KB I-cache and 32KB D-cache and 128KB unified L2 cache.
The build-in NPU supports INT4/INT8/INT16 hybrid operation and computing power is up to
0.5TOPs. In addition, with its strong compatibility, network models based on a series of
frameworks such as TensorFlow/MXNet/PyTorch/Caffe can be easily converted.

RV1106 introduces a new generation totally hardware-based maximum 5-Megapixel ISP
(image signal processor). It implements a lot of algorithm accelerators, such as HDR, 3A,
LSC, 3DNR, 2DNR, sharpening, dehaze, gamma correction and so on. Cooperating with two
MIPI CSI (or LVDS) and one DVP (BT.601/BT.656/BT.1120) interface, users can build a
system that receives video data from 3 camera sensors simultaneous.
The video encoder embedded in RV1106 supports H.265/H.264 encoding. It also supports
multi-stream encoding. With the help of this feature, the video from camera can be
encoded with higher resolution and stored in local memory and transferred another lower
resolution video to cloud storage at the same time. To accelerate video processing, an
intelligent video engine with 22 calculation units is also embedded.
RV1106 has a build-in 16-bit DRAM DDR3L capable of sustaining demanding m
