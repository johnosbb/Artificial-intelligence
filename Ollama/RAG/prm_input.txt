Background: - In simple terms:
Bezel compensation makes a video wall look right — ensuring that images, text, and graphics align across multiple screens as if the bezels weren’t there.

What It Does
Bezel compensation adjusts the video content sent to each screen by shifting or cropping pixels so that the displayed image accounts for the hidden area behind the bezels.

This makes the overall image look like one large, seamless display, even though part of the picture is physically “lost” behind the frames.

Example
Imagine a 2×2 video wall showing a large grid:

Without bezel compensation → the gridlines don’t line up; they’re interrupted by the bezels.

With bezel compensation → the system offsets the image, so the gridlines continue straight across the bezels, maintaining correct proportions.

Boxilla/DESKVUE Requirement - This is a videowall Feature and will only be possible in a managed system with video wall license.

Open the Boxilla Video Wall Setup Area

In the extender’s management software (e.g., Boxilla, or the receiver’s local OSD/configuration page), select “Video Wall” mode.

Define Wall Layout

Enter the wall dimensions: 2 columns × 2 rows.

Assign each receiver (one per display) to its correct physical location in the matrix.

Enter Panel Resolution

Specify the native resolution of each panel (e.g., 1920 × 1080).

The system will calculate total wall resolution before bezel compensation (3840 × 2160).

Configure Bezel Compensation

Input the horizontal bezel width (e.g., 10 mm) and vertical bezel height (e.g., 10 mm).

The system converts this to pixel offsets based on the display’s DPI. For instance:

10 mm bezel ≈ ~38 pixels at 1080p panel density.

The controller instructs each receiver to shift its active video window by this number of pixels.

Apply Compensation

Now the image is slightly “cropped” per display so that when viewed across the wall, lines, text, and graphics appear aligned as if bezels are invisible.

Test & Fine-Tune

Display a grid test pattern (often built into the extender or wall controller).

Verify that straight lines run seamlessly across all panels without breaks or overlaps.

Adjust bezel compensation values if necessary.

Result
Without bezel compensation:

A circle stretched across all 4 panels looks “split” and misaligned due to bezels.

With bezel compensation:

The circle looks continuous and correctly proportioned across the 2×2 layout.
